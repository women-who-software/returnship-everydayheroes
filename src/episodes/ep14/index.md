  “Memories heal the living. We pray for the living.”




  Angela: On April 26, 2020, a lot of people were staying at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At this time, the total number of deaths due to COVID-19 in the United States was nearing 56,000. In Colorado, restrictions were about to be lifted, for what Governor Jared Polis called the Safer-at-Home phase. We started to realize the importance of wearing face masks to limit the spread of the virus. This is the context for our first episode of Everyday Heroes, a conversation with Ryan Seamy, an actor and blood donor.




  Angela: Hello, and thank you for joining us today. I’m Angela Rothermel, and I’m here with Ryan Seamy. How have you been doing?




  Ryan: Good. Yeah, just a enjoying the time off. Use this time to be creative and… because normally I'd be working every day and too tired to do anything. So.




  Angela: What have you been able to do on the creative side?




  Ryan: I've been able to start a couple of things. Just a short film skit in the works and also a feature length film that I'm working on, that a friend of mine in New Mexico is writing right now. We're gonna, you know, we're just taking it from scratch and doing it together and seeing where we go with it.




  Ryan: I always have a distributor that I can work with to put out anything that I want, whether it's like one minute-long or an hour-long or, you know, feature-length or whatever. But, my next project, I’m trying to get in with the guys from Asylum. In my opinion, they're like the bridge between, you know, like the real solid gap between indie film and mainstream. You know they do the Sharknado films. They really concentrate on, on just clickbait and their titles and things that are similar to popular genres that have caught on, you know. They're notorious for taking two popular genres and mending them into one, like Snakes Out of Compton is a good example.




  Angela: It’s really exciting that you’ve been able to work on your creative projects.




  Ryan: It's like a dream come true. I mean, all this unemployment or extra money for unemployment, which obviously is not going to last very long, but you know, it's given me a real shot in the arm, you know, because this is what I would be doing if I could, just… You know, acting and making stuff, and that's how I'd be spending my time pursuing that, you know.




  Angela: What is your day job?




  Ryan: Just working in the service department. Doing that sort of thing, lots of valet parking and whatnot.
